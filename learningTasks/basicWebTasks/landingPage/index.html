            <p>I heard about Afrcia to Silicon Valley from my friends and I was excited to join. before joining A2SV I dreamt about solving real-world problems and attaining something that I could foucs on and make myslef better from it. at that time, it is safe to say; I knew very little about data structure and algorithms. It was because of the A2SV program that I got comfortable with algorthims. From the program, students also learn about imporving communcation skills and being confident besides acquring problem-sloving skills.</p>
