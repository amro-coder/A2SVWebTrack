        <div class="aboutContent">
            <p>I am an experienced Competitive Programmer. I practice in multiple competitive programming websites including ‘Codeforces’ where I am currently ranked first in Sudan with an ‘Expert’ rating (https://codeforces.com/profile/unknownSolver). Moreover, I participated in multiple competitive programming competitions where I excelled globally and achieved first place in Sudan. In 2022, I led my team to become the first Sudanese team to secure a spot in the global top 100 in the IEEEXtreme Global Competitive Programming competition, achieving 70th place worldwide out of 6600+ teams and claiming the first position in Sudan. This notable accomplishment attracted attention in local media and newspapers, and I was invited to share my experience on national television.</p>
            <p>I am also a Machine Learning enthusiast. In both 2019 and 2022, I attended the Deep Learning Indaba conference, a comprehensive week-long AI event designed to strengthen African Machine Learning knowledge. I had the opportunity to learn and seek guidance from prominent leaders in the AI field, such as Marc Peter, the author of ‘Mathematics for Machine Learning’.</p>
            <p>Throughout my AI journey, I enjoyed learning about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and developed a passion for it. As my graduation project, I worked on an NLP project, and it significantly enhanced my research skills. The project won the best graduation project award in the Faculty of Engineering (I scored 98/100). Furthermore, I authored a paper based on my graduation project, titled "Model Extraction Attacks on DISTILBERT", which was accepted for publication at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2023).</p>
